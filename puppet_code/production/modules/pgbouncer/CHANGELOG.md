## 2015-10-09 Release 0.3.0
### Summary
Better support for 1.7 release, possible impacting changes included!

### Changes
  - Changed default of global pooler to conservative value of session instead of the more aggressive transaction value. Though this is not a breaking change, it can affect performance greatly. To preserve the old behavior, please set overide the config params. Keep in mind this is a deep merge of the config_params variable with the defaults. Example hieradata below:

    ```
    pgbouncer::config_params
        pool_mode: 'transaction'
    ```
    Alternatively you can override the pool mode at the user level in 1.7 with the below syntax in your user array:

    ```
    pgbouncer::userlist:
      - user: 'username'
        password: 'password'
        pool_mode: 'transaction'
    ```
  - Optional arguments are added to the pgbouncer.ini databases section for port
  - Optional arguments are added to the pgbouncer.ini databases section for auth_user
  - Optional arguments are added to the pgbouncer.ini databases section for auth_pass
  - Optional arguments are added to the pgbouncer.ini databases section for pool_size
